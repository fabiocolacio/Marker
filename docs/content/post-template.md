### Back-links

Every time you link to another page or post

a list of pages that links to each other.

[[hello]]
[Hello1](hello.html)
[Hello2](hello.md)
[[Hello3|hello]]
[[Hello4|hello.md]]
<a href="hello.html">Hello5</a>

```markdown
[[hello]]
[Hello1](hello.html)
[Hello2](hello.md)
[[Hello3|hello]]
[[Hello4|hello.md]]
<a href="hello.html">Hello5</a>
```

In any case the `hello.html` page will have a this page
on its list of back-links:

Inline math $1 + 2$ and display math $$x + y$$

$$
