# Dual Pane Vertical Layout

The dual pane vertical layout provides an alternative to the traditional side-by-side dual pane mode, placing the editor at the top and the preview at the bottom of the window.

## Overview

This view mode is ideal for users who prefer a stacked layout when working on wider screens or when vertical space is more valuable than horizontal space. It maintains all the benefits of dual pane editing while optimizing for vertical workflows.

## Features

- **Editor on top**: Full-width markdown editor positioned above the preview
- **Preview below**: Live preview rendered below the editor for easy reference
- **Adjustable split**: Drag the divider between editor and preview to resize panes
- **Minimum constraints**: Both panes maintain minimum heights for usability
- **Scroll sync**: Optional synchronized scrolling between editor and preview (when enabled in preferences)

## Accessing Dual Pane Vertical

### Menu Access
1. Click the **gear menu** (⚙️) in the top-right corner
2. Navigate to **View Modes**
3. Select **Dual Pane Vertical**

### No Keyboard Shortcut
Currently, dual pane vertical mode does not have a dedicated keyboard shortcut. Access it through the menu or view mode cycling.

### View Mode Cycling
Use **Ctrl+Shift+L** to cycle through all view modes, including dual pane vertical.

## Usage Tips

- **Optimal for writing**: The full-width editor is excellent for long-form writing
- **Reference workflow**: Keep the preview visible below while editing for immediate feedback
- **Adjustable ratio**: Resize the panes to give more space to editor or preview as needed
- **Consistent formatting**: The preview maintains the same rendering quality as other view modes

## Related Features

## Settings

- **Scroll sync**: Enable synchronized scrolling in preferences
- **Font size**: Editor font size applies to vertical mode
- **Theme**: Both dark and light themes are supported
